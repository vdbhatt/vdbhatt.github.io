This is my blog to help write tutorials about hardware, software, AI and other odd projects which i've shelved for too long.

It's mainly towards curious engineering mindset students who want to connect the dots between different things. 

Also I keep forgetting recepies which i develop so kind of pointer to my future self ;)
